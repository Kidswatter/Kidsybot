Welcome to Kidsybot's GitHub!
===================


Kidsybot is a Discord bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage"). It is in a **very** early stage of development and is currently only based on [MusicBot](https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot "MusicBot on GitHub"). It can only play music but there *are* plans on adding more features to it.

FAQ
-------------

This section is dedicated to answering the most burning <i class="icon-fire"></i> questions about ***Kidsybot***.

 - **Who is *Kidsybot*?**
Kidsybot is [Kidswatter](https://github.com/Kidswatter "Kidswatter's GitHub")'s trusty little companion bot that accompanies them on **Discord** servers.

 - **What commands does *Kidsybot* have so far?**
 Please visit the commangs list by clicking [here](https://github.com/Kidswatter/Kidsybot/wiki/Commands-list "Commands List").
 
 - **What sites does *Kidsybot*'s music feature support?**

 - **Does *Kidsybot* support Spotify?**
 No, and probably never will. (*don't blame it for that, please*.)
 
 - **Can *Kidsybot* play streams?**
 As mentioned earlier, as of now Kidsybot is mainly based around [MusicBot](https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot "MusicBot on GitHub"), meaning it downloads the music before playing it, and therefore streams such as **Twitch.TV** and Onlie-radio are not playable.
 
 - **Does *Kidsybot* know it's not perfect?**
 No, Kidsybot is not *yet* a self-aware bot to know that it's far from perfect. (*please don't tell it that it's not perfect, it might have feelings one day.*)
 - **Why do I see *Kidsybot* being offline?**
 Unfortunately for Kidsybot, it is not being hosted on a dedicated server or a VPS, meaning it's running straight out of [Kidswatter](https://github.com/Kidswatter "Kidswatter's GitHub")'s PC, which is not running 24/7 since it's not cost-effective. Kidsybot will have its own 24/7 dedicated server either hosted on [Kidswatter](https://github.com/Kidswatter "Kidswatter's GitHub")'s spare PC (*which is currently not usable*) or on a machine from some hosting provider. (*probably in Ukraine since everything Internet-related is dirt-cheap in there*).
 
 - **What are the future plans for *Kidsybot*?**
 The developer of Kidsybot is a little *sillybean* and they need time to be able to write their own Python code, meaning Kidsybot is going to heavily rely on other open-source **Discord** bots for some time. (*wish me godspeed on improving my Python, please.*). Nonetheless, the things to do are not limited to but include:
  - Getting a 24/7 hosting solution up and running ASAP.
  - Adding search engine support (*like quick **YouTube** video search or a general **Google** search*)
  - [**Cleverbot**](http://www.cleverbot.com/ "Cleverbot Website")-like chatting option for more interactivity.
  - (*probably*) a handful of moderator commands.
 - **Can I add *Kidsybot* to my server?**
 No, Kidsybot has no plans on becoming a public bot so it's only present on severs where [Kidswatter](https://github.com/Kidswatter "Kidswatter's GitHub") is a member. If you want bots for your **Discord** server, you should just google them. If you need just a private server music bot, check out [MusicBot](https://github.com/SexualRhinoceros/MusicBot "MusicBot on GitHub").
